<h1> ABOUT HTML</H1>
<p> HTML<br><br>
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
It describes the structure of a Web page.
It consists of a series of elements.
It elements tell the browser how to display the content.
It elements are represented by tags.<br><br>
HTML TAGS <br><br>
HTML tags normally come in pairs.
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.
The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.<br><br>
THE <!DOCTYPE> DECLARATION <br><br>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
